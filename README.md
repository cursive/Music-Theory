# Harmony
 Waves



- Assign each mine to a note so that the gaps between the notes of a scale are represnted temporally too
- Maybe global/loal is when you turn on a global, any channel you move sync all the other channels
ðŸš¨ Theta is a continuously increaign number, that why it's dangeorus to manipulate it

Bugs
- Notes range cannot exceed 127, need to chop it down, adn adjust the range slider accordingly
- Need to figure out sinewave period (do I do how amny notes per priod?)

Features
- Multi channel out
- Physical controls
- Drums
- One gui panel per sinewave



Todo
- Do away scopeMin and scope max
- Scope min is nw our mode selector and moves the rang eof notes
- Scope max is how many notes in the range

Approach 2
- Therer are 7 notes in a major or minor scale
- So each period is an octave, containing 7 blobs
- The theta shoud cycle between 12 modes/offset
- So when we play the note, we play +/- the offset
- Notes belong to the mines not, not the blob
- Think of the mine horzon as the string, and the blobs as finers


Apporaoach one 1
- Nates: All notes in the key across all octaves
- Horizon: One mine for each note in the key
- Mine X pos screewndith/notes length 
- Use sliders to adjsut extremties of what notes ot play
- Blobes out of scope are grey, and don't explode mines or play music
